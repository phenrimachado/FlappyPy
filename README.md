# FlappyPy
A simple version of the famous Flappy Bird game built in Python created like my first study on the language.

All assets used in the game were found in another project (https://github.com/sourabhv/FlapPyBird), but the logic used 
was written without inspiration from that repository.

The logic used was the most simple 'cause is just the body of game but I will makes a new versions with points count, a home
menu and a "Game over" screen.
